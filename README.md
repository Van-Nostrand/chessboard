# Chess!
This is a project that has haunted me since College. I originally tried to do it in Java but screwed it up at the time. After, I was too busy to get around to finishing it. I've thought about it many times over the years so I figured I'd try to finish it for fun.

### Where it's at (August 31 2020)
the game functions! 

### Todo:
* focus on styling; I've got an alternate branch where I'm toying with using canvas and svg elements instead of png images for the pieces
* optimize code: it's a disorganized mess

### potential future todos
* implement "click and drag to move" for pieces
* implement an optional "possible moves" overlay for selected pieces
* add a timer
* add different scaling options
* experiment with changing piece references to actual chess notation (not something I'm well versed in...)
* add a system for players and player names, scorekeeping
* reviewable game history
* try refactoring it as an electron app
* try refactoring it as an android app
* changeable color schemes
