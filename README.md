# Chess!
This is a project that has haunted me since College. I originally tried to do it in Java but never finished it. I figured I'd try to finish it in react  

### January 2023
* finished adding typescript and fixed some immediate bugs
* implemented better responsive sizing
* refactored a bunch of stuff, too much to list

### ideas
* implement "click and drag to move" for pieces  
* implement an optional "possible moves" overlay for selected pieces  
* add a timer  
* experiment with changing piece references to actual chess notation (not something I'm well versed in...)  
* add a system for players and player names, scorekeeping  
* reviewable game history  
* try refactoring it as an electron app  
* try refactoring it as an android app  
* changeable color schemes
