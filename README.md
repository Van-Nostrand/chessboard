# Chess!
This is a project that has haunted me since College. I originally tried to do it in Java but screwed it up at the time. After, I was too busy to get around to finishing it. I've thought about it many times over the years so I figured I'd try to finish it for fun.

### Where it's at (July 27 2020)
as far as I can tell, everything except for pawn promotion now completely works. I'm beginning optimization now, which includes game set-up and how pieces are "created". Once that's done I'll implement pawn promotion.

### Todo: for now
* optimize code: it's a disorganized mess
* implement pawn promotion
* change how dead pieces are displayed

### Todo: in the future
* implement "click and drag to move" for pieces
* implement an optional "possible moves" overlay for selected pieces
* make it look nice
  * add a timer
  * try my hand at svg... eliminate the need for the piece png files
  * implement changeable color schemes
* change piece references to actual chess notation
* add a system for players and player names, scorekeeping
* try refactoring it as an electron app
* try refactoring it as an android app
