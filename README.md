# Chess!
This is a project that has haunted me since College. I originally tried to do it in Java but screwed it up at the time. After, I was too busy to get around to finishing it. I've thought about it many times over the years so I figured I'd try to finish it for fun.

### Where it's at (June 22 2020)
So far, pieces can be clicked on and moved, and they will respect general rules of piece movement. Pieces cannot be selected out of turn; so if it's whites turn you can't select black pieces, and vice versa.

### Todo: for now
* implement castling
* implement "en passant"
* implement checks for whether or not the king is "in check"
* implement pawn promotion
* change how dead pieces are displayed

### Todo: in the future
* implement "click and drag to move" for pieces
* implement an optional "possible moves" overlay for selected pieces
* make it look nice
  * add a timer
  * try my hand at svg... eliminate the need for the piece png files
  * implement changeable color schemes
* change piece references to actual chess notation
* add a system for players and player names, scorekeeping
* try refactoring it as an electron app
* try refactoring it as an android app
