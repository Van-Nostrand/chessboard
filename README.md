# Chess!
This is a project that has haunted me since College. I originally tried to do it in Java but screwed it up at the time. After, I was too busy to get around to finishing it. I've thought about it many times over the years so I figured I'd try to finish it for fun.  

### Where it's at (November 15 2021)
refactoring
* added eslint
* added stylelint
* added workspace rules for vscode
* restructured folder layout
* further updates to recursiveStateCopy
* created svg files for all pieces - still not sure if this is more performant or not...  

## Todo
* pawn promotion menu is not working right now, needs svg and logic update
* move functions from ChessGame into separate files - it's too monolithic
* test if rendering svg's is more performant than that one png, or if it even matters

### Where it's at (August 31 2020)
the game functions! Huzzah!  

### Future Todos
* implement "click and drag to move" for pieces
* implement an optional "possible moves" overlay for selected pieces
* add a timer
* experiment with changing piece references to actual chess notation (not something I'm well versed in...)
* add a system for players and player names, scorekeeping
* reviewable game history
* try refactoring it as an electron app
* try refactoring it as an android app
* changeable color schemes
